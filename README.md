# Date: 19/05/2025
# Reg. No.: 212222060185

## Objective

To demonstrate the capability of a text-to-VIDEO generation tool (e.g., pictory.ai) to recreate an
existing image by crafting a detailed prompt that encapsulates the original image's key features.

## Original Video Description

The prompt generated a series of scenic images representing the desired video composition,
including:
1. Sunrise over the mountains – Captures the golden sun peeking over snow-covered
peaks.
2. Lush green valleys and meadows – Several images depict deep green terrain and
winding paths.
3. Snow-capped peaks – Towering mountains under clear skies, enhancing the dramatic
landscape.
4. Outdoor activities – Individuals skiing down snowy slopes and hiking through forested
trails.
5. Forests and alpine trails – Wooded areas bathed in soft morning light, highlighting
serenity and exploration.
6. Balanced composition – The collage emphasizes a mix of nature, adventure, and
tranquility.

## EXAMPLE:

## Prompt

"Create a 60-second video showcasing the stunning landscapes of the Swiss Alps, with
dramatic shots of snow-capped mountains and lush green valleys. Include a sunrise scene
with the sun peeking over the mountains, as well as people skiing down slopes and hiking
through the forests. Add soft, ambient music to accompany the scenes."
